Hi, I am a CS Ph.D. student at UC Irvine. I am advised by [Prof. Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/). My research focusses on improving the resilience of cloud infrastructure. Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India under the guidance of [Dr. Venkat Padmanabhan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padmanab/) and [Dr. Sreangsu Acharyya](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acharyya:Sreangsu) on monitoring network availability in cloud-services like outlook, bing, and skype. I was also advised by [Shwetabh Khanduja](https://dblp.org/pid/166/5269.html) and [Dr. Arun Iyer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ariy/) on the project AI4Work on building intelligent RL based agents for recommending user action items based on their preferences in enterprise settings.

I completed my graduation with a B. Tech. in Mathematics and Computing from Delhi Technological University in 2017. After graduating, I spent eight months working with [Prof. Varun Dutt](http://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~varun/) as a Research Assistant on building low cost MEMs based IoT devices for monitoring and early detection of landslides.
