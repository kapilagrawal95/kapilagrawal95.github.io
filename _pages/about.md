Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in the [CS Department](https://www.ics.uci.edu) at UC Irvine. I am advised by [Prof. Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/). My research interests are in building resilient cloud architecture. Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India under the guidance of [Dr. Venkat Padmanabhan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padmanab/) and [Dr. Sreangsu Acharyya](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acharyya:Sreangsu) on monitoring network availability in cloud-services like outlook, bing, and skype. 

I completed my graduation with a B. Tech. in Mathematics and Computing from Delhi Technological University in 2017. After graduating, I spent eight months working with [Prof. Varun Dutt](http://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~varun/) as a Research Assistant on building low cost MEMs based IoT devices for monitoring and early detection of landslides. Our efforts led in large-scale deployment of these tiny devices prompting the interest of media. Here is a link to the [BBC news article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50313344).
