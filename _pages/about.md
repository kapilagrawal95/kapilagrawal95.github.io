Hi, I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India. I work with [Dr. Venkat Padmanabhan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padmanab/) and [Dr. Sreangsu Acharyya](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/a/Acharyya:Sreangsu) on monitoring network availability in big cloud-services like outlook, bing, skype. Previously, I have worked with [Dr. Arun Iyer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ariy/) in building personalized recommendations in enterprise settings and information extraction from hetereogeneous data. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the practical challenges that lie in scaling machine learning to the real-world, ranging from the theoretical aspects (like generalization and sample complexity guarantees) to the practical aspects (like performing low-latency inference and learning in distributed settings).

I completed my graduation with a B. Tech. in Mathematics and Computing from Delhi Technological University in 2017. After graduating, I spent eight months working with [Prof. Varun Dutt](http://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~varun/) as a Research Assistant on building low cost MEMs based IoT devices for monitoring and early detection of landslides. Our efforts led in large-scale deployment of these tiny devices prompting the interest of media. Here is a link to the [BBC news article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50313344).
